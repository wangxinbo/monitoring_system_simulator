/*
 * This class provides the functions that enable users to query the usage of the specified CPU in the
 * specified server during a given period. The query operation can retrieve the needed information in O(1)
 * time. This fast query is achieved by directly calculating the offset of the first queried time in the
 * data file. Since C++ does not provide offset operation based on lines, and only provides the offset operation
 * based on character. So, my offset calculation works under several assumtions on the data file. First, a file
 * only contains the usage information of one CPU in one server during one day. Second, each line only contains
 * information at a particular time instance (per-minute basis), e.g., the first line records the CPU usage at 
 * 00:00 of a day, the second line records the CPU usage at 00:01 etc. Third, each line has the same number of
 * characters, which is 33. The maximum number is achieved by data sample like "1414689783 192.168.255.255 0 100\n".
 * When the data at a line does not contains 33 characters, dummy space characters are appended at the end of the
 * line.
