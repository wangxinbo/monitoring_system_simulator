# monitoring_system_simulator
This project is for the coding challenge of QUANTIL.

1. This project contains two tools: "generate" and "query". 

2. "generate" is responsible for simulating the logs for one day, say 2014-10-31, just use random numbers between 0% to 100% as CPU usage. The generator should write data to files in a directory.  The timestamp is Unix time.

3. "query" is a command line tool which takes a directory of data files as a parameter and lets you query CPU usage for a specific CPU in a given time period. It is an interactive command line tool which reads a user’s commands from stdin. 

4. To use these tools, please enter their folders and read the file "README.txt". Thanks.
